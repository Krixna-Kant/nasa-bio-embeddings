Bassham1,2,3*\nAbstract\nBackground: The movement of plant roots within the soilis key to their ability to interactwith theenvironment\nand maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition.Directional growth ofroots occurs by a combinationof sensing\nexternal cues, hormonalsignaling and cytoskeletal changes in theroot cells. Roots growingon slanted,\nimpenetrable growthmediumdisplay a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants withdeviationsin these\nphenotypes assist inidentifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a rolefor a trans-Golgi\nnetwork-localizedprotein in root skewing.\nResults: We found that ArabidopsisthalianaTNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering\nfactor localized atthe trans-Golginetwork, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root\nskewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1roots increases upon microtubulestabilization, but is\ninsensitive to microtubuledestabilization.Microtubule destabilization leads to severedefects incell morphology in\ntno1seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected inthe mutant roots, suggesting that theincrease incell\nfile rotation is independentof the orientation of microtubule arrays.\nConclusions: We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing ina mechanism that is dependent onmicrotubules\nbutis notlinked to disruption of theorientation of microtubule arrays. Inaddition, TNO1 is required for\nmaintenance of cell morphologyin mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls. The TGN-localized SNARE\nmachinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root\ngrowth.\nKeywords: trans-Golginetwork, Root movement, Cell file rotation, Tetheringfactor, Microtubules\nBackground These cues are integrated and then signal downstream\nEstablishment of the root system of a plant is crucial for processes involving hormonal pathways and cell expan-\nefficient anchorage and nutrient acquisition.
