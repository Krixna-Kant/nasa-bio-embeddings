However, the mechanisms by which\norganisms respond to this stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the impact\nof three different gravitational loadings (microgravity, 1/6 g [lunar gravity], and 1 g) on the behavior,\nbone, thymus, and spleen of mice housed for 25\u201335 days in the International Space Station. The bone\ndensity reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered by 1 g but only partially recovered by 1/6 g.\nBoth 1 g and 1/6 g suppressed microgravity-induced changes in some osteoblast and osteoclast marker\ngene expression. Thymus atrophy induced by microgravity was half recovered by both 1 g and 1/6 g,\nbut gene expression changes were not fully recovered by 1/6 g. While no histological changes were\nobserved due to low gravity, alterations in gene expression were noted in the spleen. We found that\nin bone and thymus, lunar gravity reduced microgravity-induced histological alterations and partially\nreversed gene expression changes. This study highlighted organ-specific variations in responsiveness\nto gravity, serving as an animal test for establishing a molecular-level gravity threshold for maintaining\na healthy state during future spaceflight.\nKeywords Spaceflight, Microgravity, Thymus, Spleen, Bone, Gene expression\n1Laboratory Animal Resource Center in Transborder Medical Research Center, and Department of Anatomy and\nEmbryology, Institute of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.\n2College of Medicine, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba 305-8575, Japan.\n3Department of Cellular Physiological Chemistry, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of\nScience Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8549, Japan. 4Department of Rehabilitation for Movement Functions, Research Institute,\nNational Rehabilitation Center for Persons with Disabilities, Saitama 359-8555, Japan. 5Laboratory for Immune\nHomeostasis, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama 230-0045, Japan. 6Immunobiology\nLaboratory, Graduate School of Medical Life Science, Yokohama City University, Yokohama 230-0045, Japan.\n7Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and\nTechnology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8565, Japan. 8Ph.D. Program in Human Biology, School of Integrative and Global\nMajors, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 9Ph.D. Program in Humanics, School of Integrative\nand Global Majors, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 10Center for Innovative Cancer\nTreatment, Institute of Science Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan. 11Mouse Epigenetics Project, ISS/Kibo Experiment,\nJapan Aerospace Exploration, Tsukuba, Japan. 12Department of Physiology, Gifu University Graduate School of\nMedicine, Gifu 501-1194, Japan. 13Department of Nutrition Management, Tokai Gakuin University, Gifu 504-8511,\nJapan. 14Space Environment Utilization Center, Human Spaceflight Technology Directorate, JAXA, Tsukuba, Ibaraki\n305-8505, Japan. 15Department of Genome Biology, Transborder Medical Research Center, Institute of Medicine,\nUniversity of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 16These authors contributed equally: Yui Okamura, Kei\nGochi and Tatsuya Ishikawa. \uf02aemail: t-kudo@md.tsukuba.ac.jp; satoruta@md.tsukuba.ac.jp\nScientific Reports | (2024) 14:28774 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-79315-0 1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nSpace exploration has attracted attention in various fields, including materials, fuels, communication equipment,\nsystems, medicine, and botany. To further explore space, the manned lunar exploration program \u201cArtemis\u201d has\nbeen initiated, and research is underway to address the various obstacles to the space environment1,2. Notably,\nastronauts experience various environmental challenges during spaceflight including microgravity, psychological\nstress, and high space radiation. These changes pose significant threats to the various physiological functions of\nastronauts. A prolonged stay in space induces changes, such as the deterioration of bones3,4, skeletal muscle\nfunction3, vestibular control5, optic nerve papillary edema6, and cardiac hypertrophy7 among astronauts. These\nhealth issues are mainly managed through effective exercise in space; however, the mechanisms causing these\nchanges are unknown.\nSeveral drawbacks must be considered for humans to explore space. In addition, it is difficult to verify\neffects on the human space environment. Research activities at the International Space Station (ISS) have been\nconducted on various microorganisms, plants, and animals8. To stably house mice, which are higher life forms,\non the ISS, we developed breeding facilities in accordance with animal ethics guidelines, and housed mice on the\nISS for approximately one month on five occasions, including the mission reported here, and all mice returned\nto Earth alive.\nTo conduct space exploration, we must understand biological effects at the molecular level to adapt to\nspace environments such as gravity on the Moon and Mars. It is important to study the effects of long-term\ngravitational fluctuations on living organisms, to prepare for future space exploration. In 2016, we successfully\nhoused 12 mice in the ISS under either microgravity or artificial 1 g for 35 days using the Multiple Artificial-\ngravity Research System (MARS), which can exhibit varying gravitational forces using a centrifugal device\n(Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU)-1 mission)9,10. All the mice were alive after returning to Earth. The success of the\nMHU mission has been reported in the effects of microgravity on various organs, including skeletal muscles10,11,\nbone10, eye12, spleen13, thymus14, reproductive system15,16, and behavior17,18. For future manned exploration of\nthe Moon and Mars, it is necessary to understand the effects of partial gravity of less than 1 g on living organisms.\nRecently, the effects of lunar gravity on mice have been explored using MARS with two different short- and long-\nradius centrifuge lengths on the ISS (the MHU-4 and -5 missions in 2019 and 2020, respectively). Here, analysis\nof the soleus muscle of mice revealed that muscle atrophy and muscle fiber type might be regulated by different\ngravitational forces19.\nThis study aimed to present the physiological effects of three different gravity environments on mice during\nthree MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5), based on histological characteristics and gene expression. We\nfound that lunar gravity suppressed histological changes in the thymus, partially recovered bone mass loss, and\npartially recovered microgravity-induced changes in gene expression in bone, thymus, and spleen. Furthermore,\nthe responsiveness to gravity varied in different organs; this research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the\ngravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel.\nResults and discussion\nOverview of three mouse habitat unit (MHU) missions\nFigure 1A presents an overview of three MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5). C57BL/6J male mice in the\nTransporting Cage Unit (TCU) were launched aboard the SpaceX Dragon Space Vehicle from the NASA Kennedy\nSpace Center (KSC) in Florida, and subsequently transported to the ISS. In the ISS, mice were transferred\nto the Habitat Cage Unit (HCU), one mouse per cage, and then placed in a centrifuge under the conditions\ndescribed below for 35 days (MHU-1), 25 days (MHU-4), and 26 days (MHU-5). For the MHU-1 mission, 12\nmice were divided into two groups: microgravity (MG) and artificial 1 g (AG) mice. The AG group was kept in\nan artificial 1 g environment in the MARS-S centrifuge. In the MHU-4 and -5 missions, six partial gravity (PG)\nmice were kept in an artificial 1/6 g environment in MARS-S and MARS-L centrifuges, respectively. MARS-L\nis approximately 2.2 times larger in diameter than MARS-S, which decreases the gravity gradient, allowing for\nmore precise gravity settings. The ground control (GC) mice were an experimental group of C57BL/6J male\nmice of the same age, maintained under the same breeding conditions in the HCU as the space experiment in\neach mission. Experiments were conducted using six mice per mission group. A more detailed schedule for each\nmission is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. Unavoidably, it took 1\u20132 days of transport time after the cargo\nlanded to collect each organ. This information is detailed in the Method section. For both missions, the change\nin body weight before and after the space experiment occurred at approximately the same rate of increase19. In\naddition, three mice in MHU-5 experienced significant weight loss after returning to Earth due to anomalies in\nthe TCU water supply system. These mice were not used for the analysis of RNA-seq.\nBehavioral tests\nPrior to dissecting the mice after anesthetizing them with isoflurane, we visually inspected their appearance,\nbody hair, whisker morphology, incisor tooth morphology, abdominal hardness, and limb morphology. None\nof the mice returning to Earth from the three missions showed any abnormalities. Following body weight\nmeasurements, a mid-air righting reflex test and rotarod test were performed to assess vestibular function and\ncoordinated movements (Fig. 1B,C). In MHU-1, the latency to right tended to increase non-significantly in MG\nmice (176 \u00b1 19 ms) compared to those in artificial 1 g (AG) and ground control (1GC) mice (143 \u00b1 12 ms and\n130 \u00b1 7 ms, respectively) (Fig. 1B). Regardless of the same gravitational environment, the latency to right of\npartial gravity (4PG) mice (212 \u00b1 8 ms) in MHU-4 was significantly higher than that of 4GC mice (155 \u00b1 3 ms),\nwhereas that of 5PG mice (145 \u00b1 19 ms) in MHU-5 was comparable to that of 5GC mice (150 \u00b1 4 ms). In the\nrotarod test, the duration on the rod in AG (48 \u00b1 4 s) and MG (44 \u00b1 6 s) mice was significantly shorter than\nthat in 1GC (74 \u00b1 10 s) mice in the MHU-1 mission (Fig. 1C). However, the differences between PG and GC\nin MHU-4 (4PG: 49 \u00b1 5 s, 4GC: 37 \u00b1 7 s) and MHU-5 (5PG: 83 \u00b1 11 s, 5GC: 70 \u00b1 14 s) were not significant. In\nthe righting reflex test, which evaluates postural control via the vestibular system, mice from the MARS-S and\nScientific Reports | (2024) 14:28774 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-79315-0 2\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nFig. 1.

Data are\nrepresented as the mean and standard deviation (SD), and each dot represents an individual mouse (n = 5\u20136).\nP-value from the Student\u2019s t-test is indicated as ***P < 0.001.\nMARS-L in the same 1/6 g group showed different results. 4PG showed the same deterioration as MG, whereas\n5PG showed the same results as GC and AG in the 1 g group. The two possible reasons for this discrepancy\nare as follows: (1) Difference between the short and long arms: the gravity gradient in the housing chamber\nof MARS-S, which has short arms, is larger than that of MARS-L, which has long arms. Therefore, each time\nthe height of the head changes, 4PG receives a larger gravitational input into the otolith system. This may have\naffected vestibular function. (2) Difference in the control performance of the centrifuge used in 4PG and 5PG.\nThe difference is particularly noticeable in a small gravity, such as 1/6 g; the gravity fluctuation was larger in\n4PG than that in 5PG, which may have affected vestibular function in 4PG. These two possibilities should be\nexamined in future research.\nLunar gravity loading partially recovered bone mass loss caused by microgravity\nTo investigate the effect of gravity on bones, the right femur of the mice was analyzed using micro-computed\ntomography (Fig. 2A,B). MG mice in the MHU-1 mission showed a significant decrease of 70% (1GC;\n15.1 \u00b1 2.2%, AG; 14.5 \u00b1 1.2%, MG; 4.5 \u00b1 2.7%) in the trabecular bone volume corrected by the tissue volume\n(BV/TV), whereas PG mice in the MHU-4 and -5 missions showed a significant decrease in BV/TV of only\n30% (4GC; 20.6 \u00b1 2.3%, 4PG; 14.4 \u00b1 3.5%) and 28% (5GC; 27.4 \u00b1 5.6%, 5PG; 19.6 \u00b1 2.5%), respectively, although\nhousing in MHU-4 and -5 was 10 days shorter than that in MHU-1. In cortical bone, cross-sectional area (Ct.\nAr) and thickness (Ct.Th) decreased significantly by 17% (Ct.Ar: 1GC; 0.87 \u00b1 0.02 mm2, MG; 0.72 \u00b1 0.03 mm2)\nand 16% (Ct.Th: 1GC; 141.9 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b5m, MG; 118.9 \u00b1 7.7 \u00b5m) in MG mice in MHU-1. In PG mice, Ct.Ar and\nCt.Th were reduced by 5% without significant difference in MHU-4 (Ct.Ar: 4GC; 0.91 \u00b1 0.02 mm2, 4PG;\n0.86 \u00b1 0.07 mm2, and Ct.Th: 4GC; 150.4 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b5m, 4PG; 142.7 \u00b1 9.9 \u00b5m), while Ct.Ar and Ct.Th were significantly\nScientific Reports | (2024) 14:28774 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-79315-0 3\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nFig. 2.

Although BV/TV decreased in the 1/6 g environment, the degree\nof decrease was smaller than that in the microgravity environment, suggesting that bone loss was partially\nprevented in the 1/6 g environment compared with that in microgravity. Moreover, plasma levels of the bone\nresorption marker, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) significantly increased while those of the bone\nformation marker, osteocalcin significantly decreased in the MG and two of the PG mice compared to those in\nGC mice (Fig. 2C). However, compared to the increased proportion of TRAP (139%, 1GC; 3.9 \u00b1 0.5 Unit/L, MG;\n5.4 \u00b1 0.5 Unit/L) and decreased proportion of osteocalcin (49%, 1GC; 60.8 \u00b1 19.7 ng/mL, MG; 30.0 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL)\nin MG mice relative to that in 1GC mice, the proportions of TRAP (MHU-4: 127%, 4GC; 4.7 \u00b1 0.3 Unit/L, 4PG;\n6.0 \u00b1 0.4 Unit/L and MHU-5: 139%, 5GC; 4.0 \u00b1 0.9 Unit/L, 5PG; 5.6 \u00b1 0.9 Unit/L) and osteocalcin (MHU-4: 44%,\n4GC; 34.8 \u00b1 5.9 ng/mL, 4PG; 15.4 \u00b1 4.0 ng/mL and MHU-5: 51%, 5GC; 36.6 \u00b1 4.7 ng/mL, 5PG; 18.8 \u00b1 8.5 ng/mL)\nin PG mice were comparable, indicating that these changes in proportions were inconsistent with the differences\nin bone loss rates between microgravity and the 1/6 g environment. Moreover, the similarity in osteocalcin\nvalues between AG and MG mice in MHU-1 indicated that the regulation of osteocalcin expression may be\nindependent of gravity.\nComparison of gene expression in osteocyte-rich bone tissues during microgravity and lunar\ngravity\nTo verify how gravity affects gene expression in load-bearing bones, we collected and prepared femurs and\ntibiae20 for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of an osteocyte-rich bone fraction. A total of 485 genes with\na false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping\namong MG, AG, 1GC in MHU-1 and 4PG, 4GC in MHU-4, revealing five distinct gene clusters (Fig. 3A).\nSimilar clusters between samples were not classified by the magnitude of gravity, but by each of the MHU-1\nand -4 missions. The results indicated that the changes in gene expression at 1/6 g were lesser than those in\nmicrogravity. However, as observed in previous comparisons of our thymic RNA-seq data14, this may be due\nto differences in flight schedules between missions. Since this makes changes in gene expression classified into\nclusters 2 and 5 less credible, the present study focused on clusters 1, 3, and 4. Gene ontology (GO) analysis\nidentified actin regulation-related genes in cluster 1 (Fig. 3B). Considering that the cytoskeleton is an initial\ngravity sensor20, this upregulation could be caused by transmitting variations in external mechanical forces into\nintracellular chemical signals. Cluster 3 and 4, downregulated in MG mice, included genes responsible for the\ndysfunction of mitochondria and the cell cycle; abnormalities in the cell cycle of osteoblasts have been previously\nreported in microgravity experiments21 (Fig. 3B). Although these genes were downregulated in the microgravity\nenvironment, they were suppressed in the 1/6 g environment.\nEnhancement of osteoblast and osteoclast signals under microgravity\nThe unloading environment during spaceflight causes loss of bone mass in mice23,24, which is induced by\ninhibited osteoblastic bone formation and enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption in a simulated microgravity\nenvironment25. However, since AG and lunar gravity had not been used in these studies, the effect of different\nloading gravities on gene expression in bone during spaceflight remains unclear.\nHence, to elucidate the effects of microgravity, 1/6 g, and 1 g onboard environment on the gene expression in\nthe osteocyte-rich bone fraction, eight osteoblast lineage marker genes and seven osteoclast marker genes were\nselected and visualized using heat mapping (Fig. 3C). We compared the expression levels of osteoblast markers\nBglap, Bmp4, Sost, and Spp1, which are mainly expressed by osteoblasts and osteocytes in bone and regulate\nosteoblastic bone formation. The expressions of Sost, Bmp4, and Spp1 were significantly higher in MG mice than\nthose in 1GC mice. However, Bglap expression was significantly lower in MG mice than that in 1GC, and tended\nto be lower than that in AG mice. In addition, these changes were absent when comparing 4GC and 4PG mice in\nthe MHU-4 mission (Fig. 3D). Changes in Bglap expression in the osteocyte-rich bone fraction and the plasma\nconcentrations of its product, osteocalcin, were similar between the experimental groups (Fig. 2C). Though bone\nloss during spaceflight is mainly caused by osteoblast inhibition, our results showed that the gene expressions of\nsome osteoblasts increased after approximately one month of flight. A recent study using medaka fish showed\nthat osteoblast marker genes are upregulated immediately after exposure to microgravity22. Therefore, the gene\nupregulation in our study might have occurred during the early phase of spaceflight. In contrast, Bglap expression\nwas significantly downregulated under microgravity. In a previous 14-day space experiment, murine osteoblasts\nshowed reduced expression of transcription factors and proteins involved in osteoblast differentiation23. This\nsuggests potential negative regulation of gene expression for osteoblast differentiation during spaceflight,\nfollowing an initial phase of upregulation. In summary, osteoblast-related genes may undergo distinct regulatory\nmechanisms contingent on the specific phase of spaceflight. Further, the expressions of osteoclast marker genes,\nAcp5 and Ctsk, both of which are specifically expressed by osteoclasts, regulate osteoclastic bone resorption,\nwere significantly upregulated in MG mice compared to those in GC mice, and these changes were partially\nsuppressed in PG mice (Fig. 3E). The changes in Acp5 expression between the experimental groups were similar\nto those in the plasma levels of TRAP, the product of Acp5. Thus, the expressions of osteoblast and osteoclast\nmarkers were significantly altered in the bone under microgravity, and these changes were mostly suppressed\nunder AG and 1/6 g, suggesting that the bone is highly sensitive to gravitational alterations.\nThe thymus under lunar gravity is histologically normal, although microgravity does not\nprevent weight loss\nFollowing spaceflight, the thymus is known to undergo atrophy24\u201326, and findings of the MHU-1 mission also\nsuggest that the weight of the thymus decreases in a microgravity environment, and artificial 1 g partially\nprevents this decrease14. In MHU-1, the mean thymus weight normalized by body weight in AG mice was\nScientific Reports | (2024) 14:28774 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-79315-0 5\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nFig. 3.

In contrast, the mean thymus weight normalized\nby body weight in PG mice in MHU-4 and -5 decreased to 76.4% (4GC; 1.44 \u00b1 0.17, 4PG; 1.10 \u00b1 0.22) and 79.2%\n(5GC; 1.49 \u00b1 0.14, 5PG; 1.18 \u00b1 0.04) of that in GC mice, respectively. This indicates that 1/6 g and artificial 1 g\npartially suppressed gravity-induced thymus reduction in mice (Fig. 4A). Hematoxylin\u2013eosin (HE) staining and\nimmunohistochemical analysis were performed to determine the cause of thymus weight loss due to housing\nin a 1/6 g environment. HE staining revealed no significant changes between PG and GC mice (Fig. 4B). This\nconfirms that no abnormalities were also observed in the thymus of MG mice by HE staining carried out in our\nprevious study14. In our previous study, immunostaining with anti-keratin-5 (Krt5; a marker for the medullary\nregion) and keratin-8 (Krt-8; a marker for the cortical region) in the thymus of MHU-1 MG mice showed that\nKrt5-positive medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are mislocalized in the cortical region14. In the present\nstudy, no significant changes were observed in the global structure and size of the medullary and cortical regions\nin PG mice (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, immunostaining with anti-Aire (a transcription factor expressed in the\nmedullary region), Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-1; a marker for mTECs), and nuclei showed no differences\nbetween PG and GC mice (Fig. 4C). This result concurs with the lack of abnormality in the distribution of their\nexpression, which we previously found to be unchanged among MG, AG, and GC mice in MHU-114. Thus, the\nabnormal distribution of thymic epithelial cells may depend on the degree of gravitational change. In summary,\n1/6 g and artificial 1 g partially countered thymic weight loss and prevented histological changes induced in the\nmicrogravity environment.\nGene expression in the thymus under different gravitational loads\nRNA-seq analysis was performed to determine the effects of different gravitational environments on gene\nexpression. A total of 2880 genes with an FDR < 0.05 between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster\nheat mapping, subsequently revealing five distinct clusters (Fig. 4D). Horizontal clustering between mice classified\nthem into 1 g group (1GC, 4GC, 5GC, and AG) and less than 1 g group (4PG, 5PG, and MG). Furthermore,\neven in the 1 g environment, the space experiment (AG) and GC experiments (1GC, 4GC, 5GC) were classified\ninto different groups. This may reflect changes in the process of the space experiment and GC experiment. GO\nanalysis further revealed that cluster 1, which was downregulated in PG and MG mice compared to that in GCs,\ncontained genes associated with endothelial morphogenesis (Fig. 4E). Consistently, altered localization of the\nvascular endothelial growth factor receptor has been reported in human CD34+ stem cells under simulated\nmicrogravity27. Cluster 3 and 4 indicated upregulated gene expression in PG and MG mice compared to those in\nGCs; particularly genes included in cluster 4 were only upregulated in MG mice. Clusters 3 and 4 included genes\nassociated with cell migration. Thymic atrophy is caused by various physiological stressors, including aging and\ninfections28\u201330. Previous studies using protozoan-infected mice have demonstrated thymic atrophy, wherein T\ncells migrate from the thymus to peripheral lymphoid organs31. Similarly, the effects of microgravity and 1/6 g\nmay potentially induce the release of several molecular ligands that control cell migration and contribute to\nthe establishment of thymic atrophy. Cluster 2 and 5, downregulated in MG mice, comprised genes associated\nwith the cell cycle. RNA-seq analysis of the thymus from two independent flight experiments, MHU-1 and -2,\nhas revealed differences in the gene expression profiles between the two missions owing to differences in flight\nschedules and conditions14. Nevertheless, integrated results have shown an impact on cell cycle progression\nwithout significant signs of apoptosis enhancement in relatively long-duration spaceflight14. Consistently,\napoptosis did not influence any of the five clusters. Moreover, our results implied the influence of cell cycle-\nregulating genes in clusters 2 and 5. Cluster 2 is downregulated in MG, but not in PG mice, suggesting that it\ncontributes to the suppressing thymic weight loss in 1/6 g. Cluster 5 showed different gene expression profiles\nbetween 4 and 5PG mice because centrifuges with different radii might affect the gravity gradient in the cage.\nInterestingly, the cell cycle may be affected by slight changes in gravity. Changes in gene expression in the mouse\nthymus due to hypergravity are inhibited by a surgical lesion in the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear32.\nThe simultaneous exposure of human fibroblasts to simulated microgravity and radiation exhibits more\npronounced effects on the expression of cell cycle-regulating genes than those with radiation exposure alone33.\nHence, our results demonstrated the effect of gravity on the cell cycle in the space experiment by comparing the\nPG and MG mice. Additionally, osteosarcoma tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs have been reported\nduring hindlimb unloading34. Therefore, it is critical to determine the cancer risk associated with changes in\ngravity. Future studies using other gravity loads will clarify the risks of thymus atrophy and carcinogenesis\nduring spaceflight.\nOur previous study implied that artificial 1 g can alleviate thymic atrophy during spaceflight despite AG mice\nexperiencing slightly lower gravity than that of GC mice owing to the relatively small radius of cage rotation14.\nIn this study, we showed that 1/6 g could alleviate thymic weight loss, similar to AG. However, gene expression\nprofiles in PG mice were different from those in AG mice, which suggests that 1/6 g is still insufficient to attenuate\nall changes during spaceflight. Future studies using MARS are warranted to identify a gravity threshold that can\nprevent gene expression changes in space.\nIn summary, the effects of both the space experimental procedure and low gravity on thymus atrophy may be\ninvolved, which is consistent with the clustering patterns of exhaustive gene expression.\nThe effect of microgravity in the spleen was alleviated in lunar gravity\nThe spleen is an important secondary lymphoid organ involved in the acquired immune responses during\nspaceflight35. Our previous study implied that erythrocyte-related genes regulated by the transcription factor\nGATA1 are significantly downregulated in the spleen of MG mice in the MHU-1 mission13. To elucidate the\neffect of 1/6 g on secondary lymphoid organs, we analyzed the histological and gene expression changes in the\nspleen. Body weight-normalized spleen weights in MG mice tended to be lower than those in GC mice; the\nScientific Reports | (2024) 14:28774 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-79315-0 7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nFig. 4.

Our previous\nHE staining results showed that MG and PG mice have a normal splenic structure with white and red pulps\n(Fig. 5B). Furthermore, no specific abnormalities are observed in immunostaining with Ter119 (erythrocyte\nmarker), B220 (B cell marker), and CD3e (T cell marker), similar to those reported previously in MG mice13\n(Fig. 5C).\nRNA-seq analysis of the spleen was performed to comprehensively investigate the impact of different\ngravitational forces on gene expression. A total of 94 genes (FDR < 0.05) between MG and 1GC mice were\nvisualized using cluster heat mapping, revealing five distinct clusters (Fig. 5D). These genes were also classified\nby horizontal clustering into mice experiencing spaceflight (5PG, MG, and AG) and mice in the ground control\n(1GC, 4GC, and 5GC), indicating that the general gene expression changes in the spleen were caused by the space\nenvironment and experimental processes rather than by gravity changes. Although difficult to comprehend, data\nfrom 4PG mice were dispersed in both these groups. Based on the results of horizontal clustering, the relevant\nfactors of the space experiment, such as radiation or stress, may have largely affected gene expression profiles in\nthe spleen. Therefore, we further compared gene expressions among 4PG, 5PG, MG, and AG mice to elucidate\nthe effects of different gravitational loads. A total of 167 genes with an FDR < 0.05 between MG and AG mice\nwere visualized using cluster heat mapping, revealing three distinct clusters (Fig. 5E). Horizontal clustering\nclassified them into 1 g (AG) and less than 1 g (4PG, 5PG, and MG) groups, indicating that PG mice showed\ngene expression patterns similar to those of MG mice. GO analysis also suggested that cluster 2, with upregulated\ngene expression in PG and MG mice, included genes associated with the inflammatory response (Supplementary\nFig. 2). In cluster 3, upregulation was observed only in MG mice, suggesting that 1/6 g could partially alleviate\nthe gene expression changes in microgravity.\nWe further compared the expression of erythrocyte-related genes in the spleen. Erythrocyte-related genes,\nregulated by Gata1 and Tal1, are downregulated due to the combined effect of space environments13. Moreover,\nexperiments in Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2) knockout mice suggest that these changes are not induced by\nflight-related stress but by other space-specific factors36. To elucidate the effect of different gravitational forces\non erythroid genes, we compared the expression of 19 genes regulated by Gata1 and Tal1 (Fig. 5F). All genes\nwere downregulated in MG and both PG mice, but these reductions were partially alleviated in AG mice.\nFurthermore, we compared the expression levels of Alas2, Slc4a1, Hba-a2, and Rhag, which are known to regress\nafter spaceflight regardless of Nrf2 expression36 (Fig. 5G). The expression levels of Alas2, Slc4a1, and Hba-a2\nwere significantly lower in MG mice than those in GC mice. Moreover, these changes were not observed in either\nAG or PG mice. Consequently, gravity loading may partially rescue the downregulation of these erythropoiesis-\nrelated genes. This observation aligns with the hypothesis that weightlessness contributes to anemia during\nspaceflight37.\nAlthough we have uncovered novel facts that can only be elucidated through space experiments, our study\nhas several limitations. First, because our space experiments only used mice, it is unclear whether our findings\ncan be applied to human biology. Another limitation is that the tissue samples were collected on the second\nday after the mice returned to Earth. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that our data, especially the\nRNA-seq data, were altered by the effects of exposure to the 1 g environment. Although space experiments must\naddress various issues to be implemented, this study will serve as a resource for future research.\nIn conclusion, using MARS, we evaluated the effects of microgravity and 1/6 g in the bone, thymus, and\nspleen. In the bone and thymus, morphological and gene expression changes induced in microgravity\nwere not completely alleviated in 1/6 g. In contrast, the gravitational threshold for the spleen exited around\n1/6 g, considering the preserved splenic weight and structure. Thus, responsiveness to gravity, phenotypic\nabnormalities, and gene expression patterns varied in each organ. In addition, two different centrifuges were\nused to generate 1/6 g in MHU-4 and -5, with different centrifuge radii, resulting in different speeds and gravity\nloads to the cephalic position. Although differences were observed between the MHU-4 and -5 missions in the\nrighting reflex test, the marginal differences in RNA-seq findings for the thymus and spleen were negligible\ncompared with those in other gravity conditions.\nThis research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular\nlevel required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms and\nfurther evaluating the gravitational threshold for each organ may offer strategies to maintain skeletal structure\nand immune systems in future space exploration.\nMethods\nMice\nC57BL/6J male mice (Stock #000664) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) for\nthe space experiments and Charles River Laboratories (Yokohama, Japan) for ground control experiments.

MARS-L is approximately 2.2 times\nlarger in diameter than MARS-S, which decreases the gravity gradient, allowing for more precise gravity settings.\nExperiments on the GC group in each mission were conducted at the JAXA Laboratory in Japan a few months\nafter the space experiments were completed. Six age-matched (8- or 9-weeks old) male C57BL/6J mice per\nmission were used, and the time spent in the TCU or HCU was the same for each space experiment. Phenotypic\nanalyses for all three missions were conducted by the same researchers. Unavoidably, it took approximately 2,\n1.2, and 2.3 days of transport time for MHU-1, -4, and -5, respectively, after return to Earth for initiating the\nexperimental analysis at Explora Biolabs.\nThe return phase and animal dissection\nAfter unberthing from the ISS, the Dragon vehicle splashed down in the Pacific Ocean near California. After a\nship picked up the cargo, the returned TCU was transported to a port in Long Beach (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nJAXA later received the TCU from NASA and transported it to Explora Biolabs in San Diego for further analysis.\nThe health conditions of the mice were checked and their body weights were measured. Subsequently, the mid-\nair righting reflex test was performed. Each mouse oriented in the supine position was dropped twice from a\nheight of approximately 40 cm above the padded surface, and the average time for righting was analyzed using\nhigh-speed video (DSC-RX100M5, SONY, Tokyo, Japan). The rotarod performance test was performed after\nthe righting reflex test. First, the mouse was placed on a rod rotating at a speed of 2 rpm to acclimate it, and the\nexperiment began when the mouse was able to stay on the rod (47600, Bioresearch Center, Nagoya, Japan). The\nrotation speed of the rod was accelerated from 2 to 40 rpm in 2 min using a ramping acceleration mode. The time\neach mouse could stay on the rod was measured. For each mouse, the rotor test was performed three times, and\nthe average of the last two tests was used as the data for each mouse.\nIsoflurane-anesthetized mice were euthanized using exsanguination and dissected to collect tissue samples.\nSamples that required cryopreservation were transported by air in a refrigerated box containing dry ice. The\njourney from the laboratory where the dissections were performed in the USA to JAXA\u2019s laboratory in Japan\ntook several days in all instances (MHU-1, 4.0 days; MHU-4, 7.5 days; MHU-5, 5.5 days), and temperature\nchanges during that time were checked using temperature data loggers.\nMicro-computed tomography analysis\nAfter fixation with 70% ethanol, distal regions of the femur were analyzed. Micro-computed tomography\nscanning was performed using a ScanXmate-A100S Scanner (Comscantechno, Yokohama, Japan). Reconstructed\nthree-dimensional microstructural image data were analyzed and all parameters were calculated according to\npreviously published guidelines38 using TRI/3D-BON software (RATOC System Engineering, Co., Ltd, Tokyo,\nJapan). Briefly, parameters of trabecular tissue volume (TV, mm3), trabecular bone volume (BV, mm3), trabecular\nbone thickness (Tb.Th, \u00b5m), trabecular bone number (Tb.N, /mm), trabecular bone separation (Tb.Sp, \u00b5m;\nintervals among trabecular bones), average thickness of cortical bone (Ct.Th, \u00b5m), and cross-sectional area of\ncortical bone (Ct.Ar, mm2) were measured directly based on the computed tomography images. A percentage of\nthe trabecular bone volume for the total tissue volume was calculated as BV/TV (%). Bone mineral content in\nthe trabecular bone tissue (BMC/TV, mg/cm3) and bone mineral density in the cortical bone (BMD, mg/cm3)\nwere measured with a bone mineral quantification phantom.\nMeasurement of plasma TRAP and osteocalcin\nPlasma levels of TRAP and osteocalcin were measured with MouseTRAP\u2122 (TRAcP 5b) ELISA (Immunodiagnostic\nSystems, UK), and Mouse Gla-Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Takara Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan) according to\ninstructions provided by the manufacturer.\nIsolation of bone tissues\nBone tissues were prepared as previously described with modifications20. Connective tissues and the periosteum\nof femurs and tibiae were removed, and the bones were cut at the metaphyses. After bone marrow cells were\nremoved from the diaphyses of femurs and tibiae by flushing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the bones\nwere incubated with 1 mg/mL collagenase and 2 mg/mL dispase in alpha-minimum essential medium at 37 \u00b0C\nScientific Reports | (2024) 14:28774 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-79315-0 11\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nfor 20 min, and then treated using a micro-interdental brush. The remaining bone was used as an osteocyte-\nenriched bone. The bones were collected in TRIZOL reagent and ground into a powder using a tissue pulverizer\n(Minilys, Bertin Technologies, France) for total RNA extraction.\nRNA-sequencing analysis\nTotal RNA was extracted from bone, spleen, and thymus using TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The RNA-seq library was prepared from 50 ng RNA using\nthe NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) after rRNA\ndepletion (NEB NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit). Paired-end sequencing (2 \u00d7 36 bases) was performed using\nNextSeq500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequence reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using CLC\nGenomics Workbench (Version 10.1.1; Qiagen, Redwood City, CA). Gene expression levels were calculated as\nthe total read count normalized to transcripts per million. Genes with 0 counts in all samples and genes with\ntotal lead counts of 5 or less were excluded. Differential expression was analyzed using the Empirical Analysis of\nDGE tool (edgeR)39 in the CLC Main Workbench (CLC MW, Version 21.0.3; Qiagen). Differentially expressed\ngenes were extracted among the conditions (MHU-1_GC vs. MHU-1_MG, MHU-4_4GC vs. MHU-4_4PG, and\nMHU-5_5GC vs. MHU-5_5PG) with FDR-corrected P < 0.05.\nGene functional analysis\nThe clustering heatmap was generated in Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/). GO\nanalysis of each cluster was performed using the Enrichr webtool (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/).\nHistological and immunostaining of tissue sections\nFor histological analysis, the spleen and thymus were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 h at 4 \u00b0C and\nembedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections of 5-\u03bcm thickness were mounted on glass slides and subjected to\nHE staining. For immunohistochemical analysis, the spleen and thymus were snap-frozen in optimal cutting\ntemperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Japan). Frozen sections of 6-\u03bcm thickness were mounted on glass slides\ncoated with amino silane.

Images were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope. At least\nthree different sections were analyzed for each sample (Leica, SP8).\nStatistical analyses\nAll data are presented as the mean of biological replicates and dots of the individual sample data. Comparisons\nbetween groups (excluding RNA-seq analysis, as explained previously) were performed using appropriate\nstatistical tests for each data set. Tests for normal distribution were carried out using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test.\nNormally distributed data were tested using Student\u2019s t-test for paired samples (MHU-4 and -5), and one-way\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey\u2019s test for multiple independent groups (MHU-1). Non-\nnormally distributed data were tested using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for paired samples (MHU-4 and -5),\nand the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, followed by Dunn\u2019s test for multiple independent groups (MHU-1).
