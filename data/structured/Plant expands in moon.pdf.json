W. A. van Loon 2,3, Luigi Gennaro Izzo 1, Maurizio Iovane 1 &\nGiovanna Aronne 1\nUnderstanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing\neffective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the\nimpact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa\n(commonly known as \u201cwater lentils\u201d or \u201cduckweed\u201d), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although\nan experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously\nconducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth\nand morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity,\nsimulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random\npositioning machines and the large\u2011diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight\nreaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa.\nThe relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity\nwere reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed\ndifferences in plant dimensions and frond length\u2011to\u2011width ratios under diverse gravity conditions.\nOur findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and\nmorphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for\nother crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained\nsubstantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a\nspace crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development\nof sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration\nmissions.\nWolffia globosa, commonly known as \u201cwater lentils\u201d is a member of the Wolffoideae subfamily within the Lem-\nnaceae family, shares similar biological traits with its Lemnoideae relatives: it is the smallest flowering plant and\nshows the fastest growth rate in the plant kingdom and lacks a pseudo root system1,2. Due to its rapid growth\nrate, high protein content, and nutritional value, it has emerged as a promising candidate for sustainable food\nproduction, particularly in agriculturally challenging regions3\u20136. This unique plant has recently garnered atten-\ntion also as a potential bioregenerative life support system (BLSS) candidate7, offering traits that align with\nclosed-loop, resource-efficient systems like those adopted for the ESA MELiSSA Loop8. Nevertheless, as for\nother candidate space crops9,10 to assess the suitability of Wolffia\u2019s in space cultivation and its ability to recycle\nresources efficiently, further laboratory tests investigating growth, nutrition, and genetic responses under extreme\nconditions are fundamental7.\n1Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Portici, Italy. 2Department Oral and\nMaxillofacial Surgery/Pathology, Amsterdam Movement Sciences and Amsterdam Bone Center (ABC), Amsterdam\nUniversity Medical Center Location VUmc and Academic Center for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), Amsterdam,\nThe Netherlands. 3TEC-MMG-LIS Lab, European Space Agency (ESA) Technology Center (ESTEC), Noordwijk, The\nNetherlands. *email: leoneermes.romano@unina.it\nScientific Reports | (2024) 14:410 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 1\nVol.:(0123456789)\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nStudying the effects of various stimuli, including different gravity environments, radiations, and their inter-\nactions, on the growth and development of plants can be challenging and costly7,11. Space limitations within\nonboard test facilities, such as the International Space Station or orbiting vectors, often restrict the number of\nreplicates, making studies under these conditions even more d emanding12\u201314. However, cost-effective alternatives\nexist in the form of facilities that simulate microgravity and partial gravity levels by continuously altering the\ngravitational v ector15\u201317. These facilities offer higher replicate numbers and serve as robust testbeds for experi-\nments involving different gravity levels18,19.\nHypergravity, characterized by gravitational forces greater than Earth\u2019s standard 1 g, is a significant factor in\nspace exploration, affecting humans, and plant life20,21. Hypergravity is most prominent during the manuvers of\ntake-off and landing phases of spacecraft. These brief yet intense episodes of increased gravitational force can\ninfluence various aspects of plant biology and growth21. Understanding how plants respond to hypergravity is\nessential for optimizing their cultivation in space environments and for Earth\u2019s agriculture22,23. Furthermore, it\nprovides valuable insights into the mechanisms plants employ to withstand and adapt to extreme gravitational\nconditions24,25.\nEarlier studies under simulated microgravity have shown stable anatomical morphology in Wolffia plants26,\npossible effects of hypergravity on plant growth and reproduction have not yet been investigated. Testing plant\nreactions of potential space crops under varying gravity levels, including those experienced during take-off,\nlanding, or in partial gravities, is reported as c rucial27. Consequently, exploring the adaptability of Wolffia plants\nunder different gravitational conditions significantly contributes to our understanding of their potential7.\nRecent genome sequencing of Wolffia australiana has shed light on the gravity-sensing mechanisms and\nphotomorphogenesis in Wolffia plants28,29. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister species Wolffia\naustraliana, we also hypothesised for Wolffia globosa a lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a\nreduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics.\nMore specifically, we aim to study the effects of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphology\nof Wolffia globosa. Leveraging the capabilities of random positioning machines and large-diameter centrifuges,\nwe simulated microgravity, partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity conditions to comprehensively explore\nthe impact of varying gravitational environments on this plant species. These machines allow us to generate\nand study a range of gravity conditions, thereby elucidating Wolffia globosa\u2019s responses to these diverse gravity\nenvironments and assessing its potential utilisation in space-based food production systems.\nMaterials and methods\nPlant material and cultivation\nPlants of Wolffia globosa (9910) have been provided by Prof. Klaus Apperoth from the Department of Plant Physi-\nology of the University of Jena, Germany. Upon receive, plant material was surface sterilised with 0.3% bleach/\nwater solution for 5 min30. After 14 days from disinfection, plants were subcultured for 30 days in N-medium30\nunder axenic conditions. Therefore, plant material has been transferred under a laminar flow hood in sets of\n6-well plates, each filled with 5 ml of N-medium solution and sealed with micropore\u00ae tape. Before the experimen-\ntal run, plants were acclimatised for 24 h at 30 \u00b0C. After acclimatisation, an average of 20 \u00b1 4 fronds were trans-\nferred in each well of a 6-multiwell plate previously filled with 5 ml of N-medium and 0.8% of Agar to achieve\na semi-solid substrate. The experiment was conducted at 30 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C average temperature with a photoperiod\nof 16/8 h light/dark and a total Photon Flux Density (PFD) of 72.37 \u00b1 10.30 \u03bcmol m\u22122 s\u22121 for 168 h2. Carbon\ndioxide concentration has been monitored throughout the experiment, resulting in an average concentration\nof 303 \u00b1 34 ppm.\nHardware description and dimensions\nExperimental hardware has been developed to hold two multiwell plates in a setup that minimises the gravity gra-\ndient between the upper and lower multiwell plates. Furthermore, the experimental hardware had to be designed\nto fit in most test facilities, setting the lower constraints to an overall dimension of 15*15*15 cm of the smallest\nRandom Positioning Machine (RPM) available.. Considering these constraints, we designed and developed the\nexperimental hardware using the free available software SketchUp\u00ae (Fig. 1). Due to the constraints described\nbefore, multiwell plates had to be stacked vertically. This setup minimises the distance of the two centres of mass\nof both multiwells so that the difference in acceleration can be neglected. The experimental hardware has been\nequipped with LED white light (Goming LTD) to ensure proper plant development.\nFurthermore, 3 cm 5 V fans have been added to the experimental hardware to increase uniformity between the\ntemperature inside and outside the experimental hardware (Fig. 1). The prototype of the experimental hardware\nhas been built in plywood. Plywood has been laser cut, and parts have been glued in place with vinyl glue. The\ntemplate for laser cutting can be found in supplementary material Appendix A. Nevertheless, the experimental\nhardware can be 3D printed in any plastic material, and information for the 3D model can be found on the\ndirectory: GitHub.\nThe inner dimension of each experimental hardware is designed to fit a multiwell plate of standard dimen-\nsions (12.7 \u00d7 8.5 \u00d7 2.2 cm). From the multiwell lid to the lighting system, a fixed distance of 2.0 cm has been set\nup to guarantee optimal light intensity for plant growth. The experimental hardware\u2019s design and dimensions\nare reported below (Fig. 2).\nLighting system\nLight treatment has been achieved utilising two 10 cm 5 V LED stripes illuminating each multiwell plate (Fig. 1).\nVia USB connector, the light was connected to a Wi-Fi USB switch that controlled the lighting system and\nphotoperiod to a 16/8 light/dark cycle. Light emission spectrum has been determined with a spectroradiometer\nScientific Reports | (2024) 14:410 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 2\nVol:.(1234567890)\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nFigure 1.

In addition, a control group under Earth gravity conditions\nwas included for comparison (Fig. 4).\nSimulated microgravity (sim-\u00b5g) was achieved using an RPM (Random Positioning Machine, original Dutch\nSpace Leiden, NL; currently Yuri Space, Meckenbeuren, DE) that allowed the plants to be positioned within\nScientific Reports | (2024) 14:410 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 3\nVol.:(0123456789)\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nTotal PFD PPF YPF PPE R:FR\nAverage 72.37 70.23 59.50 0.84 7.54\nStdev. 10.30 9.99 8.47 0.00 0.01\nTable 1.

This\nproprietary software generated motion can enabled the examination of plant responses to partial gravity ranging\nfrom nearly zero to 0.9 g levels27.\nHypergravity conditions were obtained using the large-diameter centrifuge (LDC)32. Two hypergravity levels\nwere tested: 2g and 4g, corresponding to twice and four times the gravitational force on Earth, respectively. These\nconditions allowed investigation of how Wolffia globosa responded to increased gravitational forces.\nA control group was included, where plants were grown under normal gravity conditions (1g) in a static\ngondola. This control group served as a baseline for comparing the growth and morphology of Wolffia globosa\nunder different gravity treatments.\nScientific Reports | (2024) 14:410 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 4\nVol:.(1234567890)\nnoitubirtsid\nrewop\nlartceps\ndezilamroN\n043 853 673 493 214 034 844 664 484 205 025 835 655 475 295 016 826 646 466 286 007 817 637 457 277 097 808\nWawelength (nm)\nFigure 3.

It captured\ntop-down images of the multiwell plate placed on a lighting table with a white semi-transparent Polyvinyl chlo-\nride panel illuminated by an LED light panel, ensuring uniform lighting conditions. The images thaken with this\nsetup were used to evaluate growth. Morespecificaly, the relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated by comparing\nthe area occupied by the plants in pixels at the start of the experiment (t0) and after 168 h (t168). Doubling time\n(DT) was determined based on RGR.\nStereo Microscope Setup: detailed morphological analysis was performed using a Leica\u00ae MZ8 Stereo zoom\nMicroscope. Images representing replicates for each treatment were captured. Images acquired with the stero-\nmicroscope were used to evaluate the morphological traits of Wolffia globosa were compared among gravity\ntreatments. Morphological traits, such as the dimensions of the long and short axes of the mother fronds, were\nmeasured using Fiji\u00ae software. Ratios between the long and short axes of the mother fronds were also calculated\nto assess frond roundness.\nImage analysis has been performed on the images gathered during the experimental run. Two types of analysis\nhave been conducted: (1) Analysis of the growth parameters (RGR and DT) (2) Analysis of the morphological\ndifferences. RGR has been calculated by comparing the area expressed in pixels occupied by the plant at two-time\nintervals (N = 12). Images were analysed using the ilastik\u00ae software described by Romano et al.33. We calculated\nDT based on RGR as described by Naumann34. To perform morphological comparison among treatments, one\nhundred mother fronds have been randomly selected throughout the different wells of the same multiwell plate\nwithin the same treatment. For coherent results, a phenological standard was determined. We have measured only\nmother fronds that had a well-formed daughter frond still attached. Morphological traits have been evaluated\nby measuring the long and short side of the mother frond. Long and short side have been always measured as\nshown in Fig. 5. Furthermore, we have evaluated the existing ratios with respect to the long side between these\ntwo measurements (N = 100)26 (Fig. 5). Measurements have been taken utilising Fiji\u00ae software.\nImage analysis data were processed and analysed using SPSS Statistics ver. 21 (IBM Corp.). Differences in\ngrowth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa among gravity treatments was assessed by one-way ANOVA\n(p < 0.05). Pairwise comparisons were performed using Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test (P < 0.05) to identify differences\namong individual treatments.\nIUCN policy statement\nExperimental studies and field research on plants (cultivated or wild), including the collection of plant material,\nmust comply with relevant institutional, national and international guidelines and legislation. We will strictly\nadhere to the IUCN Policy Statement on Research on Endangered Species and the Convention on Trade in\nEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Prof. Klaus Apperoth provided specimens in this utilised in this\nstudy from the Department of Plant Physiology of the University of Jena, Germany and are available in the col-\nlection of the up mentioned university. We confirm compliance with the IUCN policy for plant.\nResults\nRelative growth rate (RGR)\nThe analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant difference (F = 16.47, p < 0.001) for the RGR among\nthe different gravity treatments. The Eta-squared and Epsilon-squared effect sizes indicated a large effect of the\ntreatments on the RGR (Eta-squared = 0.54, Epsilon-squared = 0.51). The post hoc \u2019Tukey\u2019s test, conducted to\ndetermine the specific differences between the treatments, showed that the simulated microgravity treatment\n(sim-\u00b5g) (mean difference = 0.33, p < 0.001) had a significantly lower RGR (Fig. 6) compared to the control\ntreatment (1 g) (mean difference = 0.38 \u00b1 0.02). The simulated Moon partial gravity treatment (sim-Moon g)\nalso exhibited a lower RGR than the control treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant (mean\ndifference = 0.36, p = 0.25).\nIn contrast, hypergravity treatments (2 g and 4 g) showed higher RGR compared to the control treatment.\nHowever, there was no significant difference between the control and 2 g hypergravity treatments (mean dif-\nference = 0. 38, p = 0.99).

While\nthe results revealed some variations in growth and morphological traits among the different gravity treatments,\nthese observations present exciting opportunities for further exploration and potential applications.\nIn the realm of plant cultivation for space exploration (on orbital platforms, the Moon, and Mars), a more\nprofound comprehension of plant reactions to altered gravitational conditions is essential16. Previous studies\nhave shown various effects of microgravity on the growth of several plant species, but research on the effects of\npartial gravity and hypergravity on plants has been limited15,18. The aid of facilities such as RPMs and LDC can\nbe the perfect testing ground before experimenting with true microgravity18,19 and testing the effect of different\ngravity levels on the performances of novel space crop species7.\nPlants grown under microgravity conditions manifest a slower growth rate compared to those grown under\nEarth\u2019s g ravity35. Results from our investigation show that simulated microgravity and simulated Moon gravity\ntreatments resulted in slightly lower growth rates than the control treatment (Fig. 5). Although these differ-\nences, it is important to note that the relative growth rates observed in these treatments were still substantial,\nwith the simulated microgravity treatment exhibiting a relative growth rate of 0.33 per day and the simulated\nMoon partial gravity treatment exhibiting a relative growth rate of 0.36 per day while it was 0.38 per day in the\n1 g control plants. In addition, although reduced by the altered gravity conditions, growth rates of the Wolffia\nplants remain higher than those typically observed in other higher plant species36. Results from past experiments\nshow the relative growth rate over a span of 40 days of lettuce grown under simulated microgravity, yielding a\nrate of 0.08/day37.\nThe effects of altered gravity, especially microgravity (whether real or simulated), on higher plant species have\nbeen the subject of numerous scientific s tudies38. Wolffia globosa is the smallest higher plant, and its morphology\nis entirely distinct from other higher p lants39. It doesn\u2019t exhibit the typical morphology of roots, stems, and leaves\nbut only has a frond that cannot be associated with any of the three main organs39. The results of previous studies\non the effects of altered gravity on plant growth are not directly comparable to this species. Most of the research\nconducted focuses on the interactions between microgravity and roots10\u201312,14,21. Wolffia globosa is famously\nknown as a rootless p lant39. To further complicate matters, their rootless nature makes comparison with what has\nbeen studied so far challenging. Additionally, while microgravity has often been reported as a limiting growth\nfactor for plants40\u201342, results from tests performed under hypergravity are disagreeing. Studies on the nucleolar\nactivity or on the elongation of hypocotyls in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Cucumis sativus, showed a decrease\nin growth rates43,44. At the same time, other results suggest that hypergravity might not affect growth45. In our\nexperiment, the 2g and 4g hypergravity treatments manifest an increasing (although not statistically significant)\ntrend in growth rates compared to the control treatment (Fig. 6). This possible positive response to hypergravity\ntreatments opens up interesting possibilities for future studies and potential applications in space agriculture but\nrequires new ad hoc tests, eventually applying higher levels of hypergravity to amplify the phenomenon. In such\na scenario, hypergravity conditions could be leveraged to enhance plant productivity and biomass accumulation\nin controlled environments, such as space stations.\nConsidering that morphology plays a crucial role in plant growth, survival, and p roductivity46, we investigated\nthe effect of different gravitational treatments on the shape of Wolffia globosa frond. Moreover, results revealed\nsignificant differences among the treatments for both the long and short sides. Worth mentioning that such an\neffect occurred on plants that can be considered genetically identical.\nThe study findings revealed that the fronds of Wolffia globosa were most extended in the 1 g treatment, both\non the front and back sides. Subsequently, the sim-Moon g, sim-\u00b5g, 2 g, and 4 g treatments followed in terms of\nfrond length. These results suggest that both simulated microgravity and simulated Moon\u2019s partial gravity have\ndon\u2019t have an impact on frond elongation. Furthermore, when analysing the ratio in relation to the longer side,\nsignificant differences were observed among the gravity treatments, indicating distinct frond shapes. The sim-\u00b5g\ntreatment resulted in the most elongated frond shape, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1 g, 2 g, and 4 g treatments.\nThese findings provide compelling evidence supporting the significant influence of gravity on the morphological\ncharacteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds. The observed variations in frond length and shape among the treat-\nments underscore the role of gravity in shaping plant growth and development. Specifically, the sim-\u00b5g treatment\nconsistently induced the most pronounced changes, suggesting its potential as a key factor in determining frond\nmorphology. These results contribute to our understanding of how different gravity environments impact the\ngrowth and shape of Wolffia globosa, highlighting the importance of considering gravity conditions in cultivating\nand manipulating these plants for various space applications. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving\nthese morphological changes could provide valuable insights into the plant\u2019s ability to perceive and respond to\ngravitational cues.\nThe adaptability of Wolffia globosa to altered gravity conditions suggested by our data hints at the potential\nuse of plants from the genus Wolffia in space agriculture. These plants, characterised by rapid growth and high\nnutrient content, are strong candidates for food production in space, where resource constraints are critical7,13.\nOur findings further appraise the possible use of Wolffia globosa for space exploration and the establishment of\nsustainable agriculture in extraterrestrial environments. The robust growth and adaptability to altered gravity\nconditions can be added to the small size, rapid growth rate, and high nutrient content, confirming that this genus\ndeserves consideration for cultivation in limited space and resource-constrained environments7.\nAlthough Wolffia globosa exhibited a reduced growth rate in our experiment under simulated microgravity,\nprevious research has seen growth enactment of Wolffia globosa under simulated microgravity26. As already\nmentioned by the authors of the up-mentioned work, the enhanced growth might be linked to better utilisa-\ntion of dissolved oxygen and organic substances in the growth medium due to the type of cultivation system\nthey have employed26. The varying responses observed among different gravity treatments in our experiment\nScientific Reports | (2024) 14:410 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49680-3 8\nVol:.(1234567890)\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\ncould be attributed to the interplay between genetic variability within the Lemnaceae family and the specific\nenvironmental conditions experienced by each individual plant. Notably, the genus Wolffia comprises numer-\nous species with significant genetic diversity. Testing the effects of altered gravity on only one clone of Wolffia\nglobosa, as done in our experiment, provides a valuable starting point but may not fully capture the entire range\nof responses within the genus Wolffia. Further investigations involving multiple Wolffia species and clones are\nwarranted to explore the full extent of the species\u2019 reaction to altered gravity and better understand the role of\ngenetic variability in shaping their growth patterns.\nThe recent sequencing of the genome of Wolffia australiana has provided valuable insights into the genetic\ncharacteristics of Wolffia s pecies47. One intriguing finding is the absence of gravity-sensing genes commonly\nobserved in higher plants. More specifically, new findings have shed light on the missing LAZY proteins in\nWolffia australiana28. This genetic difference suggests that Wolffia species have evolved alternative mechanisms\nto perceive and respond to gravity cues, which may explain the distinct growth patterns exhibited under altered\ngravitational conditions. Furthermore, to some degree, the enhanced growth rate seen under the hypergravity\ntreatment could be attributed to gravity resistance genes such as PTH248. Our results partially confirmed the\nexpected limited reaction to gravity also of Wolffia globosa. The adaptability of Wolffia globosa to different gravi-\ntational conditions supported the hypothesis that the loss of gravity-sensing genes reported in the sister species\nWolffia australiana might also occur in Wolffia globosa. The slight variations in growth rates and morphological\ntraits observed among the treatments open up interesting avenues for future research and potential applications\nin space agriculture.\nIn addition to its implications for space agriculture, this research also contributes to our understanding of\nfundamental plant biology. The findings of our experiment might encourage further investigations to clarify\nthe evolutionary pathways that shaped the peculiar adaptation to gravity associated to a return to an ancestral\naquatic environment of Wolffia genus.\nData availability\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue\nreservation.\nReceived: 29 July 2023; Accepted: 11 December 2023\nReferences\n1.
