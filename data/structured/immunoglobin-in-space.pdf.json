B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly\ndiversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens.\nIg diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA\nof each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been\nincreasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput\nsequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the\nB-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the\nunimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space\nStation (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls.\nIndividual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however,\ngene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among\nanimals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations\nin the IgH and Ig\u03ba gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did not affect\nthe B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.\nKeywords\nImmunoglobulin Gene Use; Next Generation Sequencing; Bioinformatics\n1.

In addition to functional changes, lymphocyte subpopulations are altered. CD8+ T-\ncell numbers were increased during flight while other T-cell subsets were decreased\n(Crucian et al., 2013). Similar changes in phenotype also occur in animal and tissue culture\nsystems during spaceflight or ground-based spaceflight analogs such as anti-orthostatic\nsuspension (AOS) (Chapes et al., 1993, Globus and Morey-Holton, 2016, Crucian et al.,\n2014a, Nickerson et al., 2003, Sonnenfeld, 2005).\nLymphocyte subpopulations change in response to spaceflight (Allebban et al., 1994,\nChapes et al., 1999a, Gridley et al., 2009, Gridley et al., 2013, Ichiki et al., 1996, Pecaut et\nal., 2003, Sonnenfeld et al., 1990, Sonnenfeld et al., 1992) and AOS (Gaignier et al., 2014,\nWei et al., 2003). Splenic T- and B-lymphocyte counts were decreased in mice flown on the\n13-day mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavor (STS-118) compared to ground controls\n(Gridley et al., 2009). In the AOS model, Wei et al. found a reduced number of both T and B\nlymphocytes in the thymus and spleen of hindlimb unloaded Balb/c mice compared to\nnormal controls (Wei et al., 2003). Reductions in the mass of lymphoid organs has also been\nobserved (Armstrong et al., 1993, Baqai et al., 2009, Chapes et al., 1999b, Chapes et al.,\n1999a, Congdon et al., 1996, Durnova et al., 1976, Gaignier et al., 2014, Grove et al., 1995,\nPecaut et al., 2000). Spaceflight altered the phenotype of immune cells in the bone marrow,\nthe lymphoid organ in which hematopoiesis occurs (Ortega et al., 2009), and AOS reduced\nthe number of bone marrow B-cell progenitors (Lescale et al., 2015).\nWhile many studies have characterized T-cell response to spaceflight (Chapes et al., 1999a,\nCooper et al., 2001, Grove et al., 1995, Lesnyak et al., 1993, Lesnyak et al., 1996, Nash et\nal., 1992, Nash and Mastro, 1992, Sanzari et al., 2013, Sonnenfeld et al., 1998, Cogoli et al.,\n1984, Cogoli-Greuter, 2004, Chang et al., 2012, Gridley et al., 2009, Hwang et al., 2015,\nMartinez et al., 2015, Tauber et al., 2015), fewer studies have characterized the impact of\nspaceflight on B-cell populations. The characterization of B-cell receptors, known as\nimmunoglobulins (Igs), is of particular interest due to the (IgH) and light chains, which are\nencoded on separate loci (Tonegawa, 1983). The heavy chain locus encodes multiple\nVariable- (V), Diversity- (D) and Joining- (J) gene segments, while the functionally\nequivalent \u03ba (Ig\u03ba) and (Ig) light chain loci contain only V- and J-gene segments (Early et\nal., 1980, Sakano et al., 1979). During early B-cell development in the bone marrow, B cells\nundergo recombination of heavy and light chain Ig loci, in which only one of each V(D)J-\ngene segment is selected for Ig use (Hozumi and Tonegawa, 1976, Tonegawa, 1983).\nRandom and palindromic nucleotide insertion at splice sites adds to Ig diversity (Alt et al.,\n1984, Gilfillan et al., 1993, Komori et al., 1993).\nIn the Ig molecule, complementarity determining regions (CDR) confer binding specificity.\nCDR1 and CDR2 are encoded entirely within the V-gene segment, while CDR3 contains a\nportion of the 3\u2019 end of the V-gene segment, the entire D-gene segment, and a portion of the\n5\u2019 end of the J gene segment (Kabat et al., 1979, Tonegawa, 1983, Xu and Davis, 2000). As\na result of somatic recombination, B cells collectively express individual Igs that\ntheoretically can bind virtually any pathogen.\nLife Sci Space Res (Amst).

Page 3\nAn individual\u2019s Ig repertoire can be characterized using high-throughput sequencing (HTS)\nusing either genomic DNA or messenger RNA sequences isolated from B-cell populations\n(Georgiou et al., 2014, Rettig et al., 2017, Wardemann, 2017). B cells will clonally expand\nafter antigen-Ig receptor engagement, resulting in a higher portion of target-specific Ig\nreceptors within the B-cell population. There have been a number of HTS-based Ig\nrepertoire studies in human disease, ranging from infectious disease (Ademokun et al., 2011,\nKhurana et al., 2016, Lee et al., 2016, Parameswaran et al., 2013), autoimmunity (Tan et al.,\n2014, Tan et al., 2016, Zuckerman et al., 2010), and cancer (Bashford-Rogers et al., 2016,\nJiang et al., 2015, Logan et al., 2011, Montesinos-Rongen et al., 2014, Tschumper et al.,\n2012). Greiff, et al. developed a profiling framework using the Ig repertoire as an indicator\nof an individual's immunological status (Greiff et al., 2015).\nSome have explored the impact of spaceflight on Ig repertoires. In vitro challenge of human\nB cells during spaceflight resulted in lower concentrations of secreted Ig (Fitzgerald et al.,\n2009). There was no significant difference in pre- and post-flight Ig levels in peripheral\nblood of astronauts who flew aboard the ISS (Stowe et al., 1999, Rykova et al., 2008, Voss,\n1984). These samples, however, were not taken after challenge with a specific antigen. Rats\nimmunized intraperitoneally with sheep red blood cells prior to spaceflight produced\nsignificantly less serum IgG compared to immunized ground control animals (Lesnyak et al.,\n1993).\nAlthough some have explored Ig gene segment changes in the context of spaceflight or\nmodel analogs (Boxio et al., 2005, Bascove et al., 2009, Bascove et al., 2011, Huin-Schohn\net al., 2013), little has been done to characterize the impact of spaceflight on the Ig\nrepertoire in mice. Given that changes in B cells and Ig concentrations occur during\nspaceflight conditions, we tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the Ig repertoire of\nmice flown on the ISS. We examined individual Ig gene segment usage, gene segment\ncombinations, CDR3 composition, and frame work and CDR mutations in 35-week-old,\nunimmunized, female C57BL/6Tac mice flown aboard the ISS using high throughput\nsequencing.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1 Tissue Samples\nRNA samples were provided by the NASA Ames Research Center. RNA was extracted from\nthe spleen and liver of 35-week-old female C57BL/6Tac mice that were either housed in the\nISS environmental simulator (ground control, n=5), or flown aboard the ISS via SpaceX-4\n(n=5). Tissues from flight animals were collected on board the ISS 21\u201322 days post-launch\nin flight animals while tissues from ground control animals were processed similarly on a\nfour-day delay. Upon collection, spleens and livers were stored at 4\u00b0C in RNAlater\n(LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA) for at least 24 hours and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C. RNA\nextraction was performed according to manufacturer's instructions with the RNeasy mini\ncolumn (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. This was a secondary science\nexperiment and the dissection and timing of the experiment were dictated by the primary\nvalidation experiment. Animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the NASA Ames Research Center.\nLife Sci Space Res (Amst).

Page 4\n2.2 Illumina MiSeq Sequencing\nRNA samples were subjected to Illumina MiSeq sequencing at the Kansas State University\nIntegrated Genomics Facility as previously outlined in Rettig et al (Rettig et al., 2017).\nBriefly, sequencing was performed using the standard MiSeq protocol which includes oligo-\ndT-bead selection and reverse transcription of mRNA to cDNA. Ig-specific primer\namplification was not utilized. Additionally, fragmentation was limited to one minute to\nreduce fragmentation and maintain longer reads. Illumina MiSeq with paired reads of 300\nbase pairs was performed on size selected (275\u2013800 nt) total RNA isolated from the liver\nand spleen of three ground control and three flight animals based on highest RIN values\n(Spleen RIN:5.9\u20138.9, Liver RIN: 6.2\u20137.8) (Ground animals: G1, G2, G3; Flight animals: F1,\nF2, F3). Illumina MiSeq data from both spleen and liver are available by NASA GeneLab\n(https://genelab.nasa.gov, GLDS-ID Pending).\n2.3 Bioinformatic Workflow\nIllumina MiSeq sequencing reads were processed as described previously (Rettig et al.,\n2017). Briefly, FASTQ files were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench v9.5.1 (https://\nwww.qiagenbioinformatics.com/) and were quality trimmed and filtered to remove\nsequences less than 40 nt in length to prevent false V-gene segment assignment. Paired-end\nsequences and overlapping-paired (merged) sequences were mapped to both V-gene segment\nreferences obtained from the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) database (251 IgH segments, 135\nIg\u03ba segments), and to entire IgH and Ig\u03ba loci obtained from NCBI (NC_000078.6,\n113258768 to 116009954, and NC_000072.6, 67555636 to 70726754, respectively).\nMapped sequencing reads were submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for\ncharacterization of functionality and junctional analysis. Only one sequence per sequencing\ncluster was retained for further analysis as outlined in Rettig et al (Rettig et al., 2017).\nBriefly, per sequencing organization ID, the read with the most information is saved for\nfurther analysis. Antibody sequences can differ by as little as a single nucleotide and without\na unique barcoding step during amplification, removing similar, but not identical sequences,\ncould limit the breadth of the repertoire sampled. Due to this, no further filtering was\nperformed on sequences. A motif search was performed in CLC on IgH sequences that were\nidentified by IMGT as productive to determine their respective constant regions.\n2.4 Gene Segment Usage\nSequencing reads were analyzed using the IMGT HighV-Quest tool (Alamyar et al., 2012).\nV-gene segment usage was characterized as either productive or unknown functionality,\nwhere a read was considered productive if it was in frame and did not contain a premature\nstop codon as defined by IMGT. Sequences that did not fit the C-xx-W motif in non-class\nswitched H-CDR3 or C-xx-F in \u03ba-CDR3 were assigned an unknown functionality. D- and J-\ngene segment, and constant region usage was assessed in productive reads only. All gene\nsegments considered functional by IMGT (includes open reading frames and gene segments\nwithout full NCBI mapping) were included in this analysis. Reads assigned to multiple\nC57BL/6 V-gene segments were tabulated using a weighted distribution Reads containing\nonly one possible V-gene segment were assigned a count of one. Reads containing two\npossible V-gene segments were assigned a count of 0.5 for each potential V-gene segment.\nLife Sci Space Res (Amst). Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 01.\nAuthor\nManuscript\nAuthor\nManuscript\nAuthor\nManuscript\nAuthor\nManuscript\nWard et al. Page 5\nReads containing more than two potential V-gene segments were excluded from V-gene\nanalysis. Multiple V-gene segment assignments likely resulted from reads containing less\nthan a full V-gene segment as a result of random hexamer priming. Reads assigned to a\nsingle non-C57BL/6 D/J-gene segments or multiple C57BL/6 D/J-gene segments were\nreclassified as undetermined and kept for analysis. J-gene segments in which less than six\nnucleotides were identified were also classified as undetermined. Percent of repertoire was\ndetermined for each individual animal by dividing the number of sequencing reads for each\ngene segment by the total number of sequencing reads mapped to all gene segments.\n2.5 Gene Segment Combination & CDR3 Analysis\nReads assigned to non-C57BL/6 V-gene segments or multiple C57BL/6 V-gene segments\nwere removed from our V(D)J combination analyses. V(D)J combination analyses were\nperformed on productive sequencing reads and visualized through the use of bubble charts\n(Microsoft Excel) and/or circos graphs from Circos Online (Krzywinski et al., 2009).\nPercent repertoire was used to detail individual bubble charts and the average of percent\nrepertoire was used when combining mice from each treatment group for V(D)J bubble chart\nanalysis. CDR3 amino acid sequence was presented as percent of repertoire as described\nabove and by a highest to lowest ranking of abundance.\nCDR3 nucleotide alignments were created using the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment\nprogram (Katoh et al., 2002). A V-D-J-gene segment combination was selected from the top\nten percent most-represented gene segments across all individuals for both heavy and light\nchain. From each individual group, unique nucleotide sequences were isolated and aligned to\ntheir respective germline sequences provided by IMGT. Individual alignments were then\nstacked within their treatment groups and germline gaps were adjusted for consistency\nacross treatment groups.\n2.6 Complementarity Determining and Framework Region Mutation Analysis\nNucleotide substitution mutation data for complementarity determining and framework\nregions for IgH and Ig\u03ba were obtained from the IMGT HighV-Quest tool. Any mutations\ninvolving degenerate bases were removed. Nucleotide range (in base pairs), number of reads\ncontaining at least one mutation, total number of substitution mutations, and number of\nmutations per base pair position were determined for each region. Comparative values for\neach combination of region, Ig location, and treatment group were determined by calculating\nthe average of values contained in each combination\u2019s respective replicates (n=3).\n2.7 Statistical Analysis and Representation of Data\nAll statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad (version 6.0). Dot plots and bar graphs\nwere generated in GraphPad using mean values and standard deviation. Heat maps of gene\nsegment usage were generated in Microsoft Excel.\nLife Sci Space Res (Amst).

Page 6\n3 Results\n3.1 V-Gene Segment Usage\nB cells originate in the bone marrow from hematopoietic precursors, traffic through the\nperiphery and enter the spleen where they are further selected and mature (Loder et al.,\n1999). To view a snapshot of the impact that spaceflight has on the splenic Ig repertoire of\nunimmunized mice, we sequenced total splenic RNA isolated from three ground control\nanimals and three animals flown aboard the ISS. We assessed the composition of individual\nIgH and Ig\u03ba sequences. In spleen, between 104,135 and 149,675 IgH, and between 103,841\nand 175,406 Ig\u03ba sequencing reads of productive or unknown functionality were detected in\nground animals, while between 66,909 and 181,703 IgH, and between 81,889 and 107,928\nIg\u03ba were detected in flight animals (Table 1).\nThe V-gene segment contributes to the combinatorial diversity of the Ig repertoire in part\ndue to the large number of possible V-gene segments that could be selected within an\nindividual B cell. Among the six study animals 133 VH- and 108 V\u03ba-gene segments were\ndetected. Overall, the frequency of highly abundant V-gene segments and less frequently\nidentified V-gene segments were similar between treatment groups (Supplementary Figure\n1). Despite a general similarity, a pairwise comparison of animals within treatment groups\nshowed low-to-moderate levels of VH-gene segment correlation (Ground R2: 0.356\u20130.695,\np-values:<0.001; Flight R2: 0.101\u20130.360, p-values:0.0001-<0.0001) that demonstrates that\nthere is animal-to-animal variation (Table 2). A stronger correlation was seen in V\u03ba-gene\nsegments (Ground R2: 0.660\u20130.738, p-values <0.0001; Flight R2: 0.465\u20130.606, p-values\n<0.0001) (Table 2). When comparing the average abundance of V-gene segments from\nground and flight animals an R2 of 0.592 was observed in VH (p=<0.0001) and 0.810 was\nobserved in V\u03ba (p=<0.0001) (Table 2).\nWhen comparing VH-gene usage among all animals, nine gene segments represented over\nfive percent of the repertoire in at least one animal (Figure 1A). No one gene segment was\nfound at over the five percent level in all six animals. V1-53 was found in over five percent\nin five animals, V9-3 was over five percent in four animals, V1-26 and V3\u20136 in two animals,\nand the remaining (V1-78, V6-3, V5-4, V1-15, V1-19) were found at high levels in only one\nanimal.\nWithin V\u03ba, six gene segments represented over five percent of the repertoire in at least one\nanimal (Figure 1B). The most abundant gene segment, V5\u201339 comprised over 16 percent of\nV\u03ba usage in all six animals. No other V\u03ba represented over five percent of the repertoire in\nall six animals. One gene segment, V3\u20134, was found at over five percent of the repertoire in\nfour animals (G1, G2, G3, F3). The remaining four gene segments (V2\u2013137, V1-110, V4\u2013\n61, and V6\u201325) were found at greater than five percent in only one animal. There was no\nstatistical difference in top VH- or V\u03ba-gene segment usage between ground and flight\nanimals (student\u2019s t-test, p=0.6478\u20130.9609).\nWe also attempted to assess the antibody repertoire in the liver because of its role in fetal B-\ncell development. Only 592 to 1,429 Ig\u03ba sequencing reads were detected in ground control\nanimals and 425 to 543 Ig\u03ba sequencing reads were detected in flight animals (Table 3). We\nLife Sci Space Res (Amst). Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 01.\nAuthor\nManuscript\nAuthor\nManuscript\nAuthor\nManuscript\nAuthor\nManuscript\nWard et al. Page 7\ndid not characterize the heavy chain in the liver due to the low number of IgH sequencing\nreads that we detected. We assessed V\u03ba-gene segments that represented over five percent of\nthe repertoire in the spleen or liver and found 11 gene segments. Only one gene segment,\nV5\u201339, was found in the top five across both tissues (Figure 2). V3\u20134 was found in the top\nfive for all animals and tissues except flight mouse two\u2019s liver sample, where it was ranked\ntenth. Overall, the average usage of these top V\u03ba-gene segments showed low to modest\ncorrelation between liver and spleen in ground animals (R2= 0.4081, p<0.0001) and flight\nanimals (R2= 0.2727, p<0.0001). Analysis of statistical differences between individual V\u03ba-\ngene segments representing over five percent of the repertoire was not undertaken due to low\nread counts in the liver datasets.\n3.2 D- and J-Gene Segment & Constant Region Usage\nHeavy chain Ig diversity is also achieved by using, modifying and splicing of D-and J-gene\nsegments. To determine if space flight affected these processes we also assessed D- and J-\ngene usage. The most commonly detected D-gene segment in both ground control and flight\nanimals was D1-1, comprising between 30.6% to 46.8% of the repertoire (Figure 3A,\nSupplemental Figure 2A). D2-4, D2-3, D4-1, and D2-5 were detected at similar levels\namong ground control and flight animals between 3.56% and 11.39% of the repertoire.\nD3-1, D3-2, D6-3, D5-5, and D5-2, and D6-4 were detected the least often with levels\nbetween 3.6% and >0.003% of the repertoire. Because of extensive modification of D-gene\nsegments during IgH rearrangement, D-gene segments were unable to be determined for\nbetween 24.4% and 36.6% of the repertoire for all animals. There was no statistical\ndifference in D-gene segment usage between ground and flight animals (student\u2019s t-test,\np=0.1542\u20130.9840). D-gene segment usage was highly correlated between ground and flight\nanimals (linear regression, R2- 0.9935, p<0.0001).\nAdditional Ig variability is gained from the inclusion of different J-gene segments. Within\nIgH, the distribution of J-gene segment usage was less uniform than D-gene segment usage\nin both ground and flight animals. There was no consensus on the most abundantly\nexpressed gene segment as each of the four JH-gene segments was the most abundant\nsegment in at least one ground or flight animal (Figure 3B, Supplemental Figure 2B). While\nthere was no consensus use of a particular J-gene segment, usage of any J-gene segment was\nbetween 13% and 40%, showing that usage is relatively uniform. Student\u2019s t-tests were\nperformed to determine whether differences in individual gene segment usage were\nsignificant. No significant differences were found between ground and flight animals\n(student\u2019s t-test, p=0.2060\u20130.8662). As the most abundant J\u03ba -gene segment, J5, comprises\nbetween 32.6% and 47.9% of the repertoire, and is the most abundant gene segment all study\nanimals (Figure 3C, Supplemental Figure 2C). Interesting J1 ranked second most abundant\nin all ground animals while it ranked third in all flight animals. There were no statistical\ndifferences in individual JH- or J\u03ba-gene segment usage between ground control and flight\nanimals (Student\u2019s t-test, p=0.0977\u20130.9262). Linear regression revealed correlation between\nJH usage of ground and flight animals for Ig\u03ba (R2= 0.9928, p=0.0076) and IgH (R2=0.8147,\np=0.0360).\nLife Sci Space Res (Amst).

Page 8\nIg isotype composition can provide insight into the developmental stage of B cells. Because\nanimals in this experiment were specific-pathogen free, it is unsurprising that IgM\npredominated with between 62.38% and 82.81% of the repertoire (Figure 3D, Supplemental\nFigure 2D). IgG was the second most prominent isotype which trended towards a higher\npercentage of the repertoire in flight animals although the difference was not statistically\nsignificant (Student\u2019s t-test, p=0.2150). Except for a relatively high expression of IgA in\nflight mouse two, IgA was detected in between 1.43% and 4.58% of the repertoire, IgD and\nIgE were detected less than one percent in all animals. There were no statistical differences\nin Ig isotype frequency between ground and flight animals (Student\u2019s t-test, p=0.1075\u2013\n0.8277). There was a high correlation between ground and flight constant region usage\n(linear regression, R2= 0.9734, p=0.0019).\n3.3 V(D)J Combinations\nV(D)J family combinations were examined as another way to determine if recombination of\nIg gene segments was affected by spaceflight. We visualized V(D)J-gene segment\ncombinations using both bubble charts and circos plots for both IgH and Ig\u03ba. IgH showed\nmore variation between ground control and flight animals compared to Ig\u03ba when looking at\nthe most common gene family combinations. Circos plots allowed us to examine top V-gene\nfamilies, J-gene segments, and V/J pairing frequency in both IgH and Ig\u03ba.\nFor ease of display, we first grouped together all V-gene segments into their respective\nfamily. D- and J-gene segments remained as individuals. V1 was the most common IgH\ngene family used in all mice comprising, on average 51% of the V-gene family use in ground\nanimals and, on average, 57% of the repertoire in flight animals (Figure 4A\u2013B,\nSupplemental Figure 3A\u2013F). In ground-treatment animals, V9 was the second most common\ngene family in ground mouse one and ground mouse two, while V2 was the second most\ncommon gene family in ground mouse three (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 3A\u2013C). In\nflight animals, the second most common V-gene family used was unique among the three\nanimals (flight one: V3, flight two: V2, and flight three: V9) (Figure 3B, Supplemental\nFigure 4D\u2013F). The third most common V-gene family was also unique among the ground\ntreatment animals being V2, V3, and V9 for ground mouse one, ground mouse two, and\nground mouse three respectively (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 3A\u2013C). V5 was the third\nmost common family in flight mouse one, V9 in flight mouse two, and V2 in flight mouse\nthree (Figure 4B, Supplemental 3D\u2013F).\nWe found that the most common V/D/J combinations were correlated with the most\nfrequently used gene families or segments within the repertoire. When averaging among\nrepertoires, the most common IgH combination in ground-treatment animals was V9/D1/J1\n(8.66%), though this combination was only in the top five most frequent combinations in\nground mouse one and ground mouse two. The most common average combination in flight-\ntreatment animals was V1/D1/J4 (8.35%), though this combination was only detected in the\nfive most common combinations for one animal (Figure 4A\u2013B, Supplemental Figure 4A\u2013B).\nThe V1/D1/J2 combination was shared among the top five gene family combinations in all\nmice; representing 5.94% of the repertoire in ground-treatment animals and 7.73% in the\nflight-treatment animals (Supplemental Figure 4A\u2013B).

Page 9\nand flight treatment groups was the usage of the V9-gene family. This family represented the\ntop average VH-gene family used in the ground-treatment animals as well as the top\ncombination in ground mouse one and ground mouse two (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure\n4A), but only appeared once as the top gene family combination used for flight-treatment\nanimals (Figure 4B, Supplemental Figure 4B).\nWe also examined the top five V/J pairing frequencies for IgH (Figure 4A\u2013B, Supplemental\nFigure 3A\u2013F, Supplemental Figure 4C\u2013D). For ground animals, there were six unique\npairings represented. The V1 family was used for four of the six unique V/J pairings\ncompiled. V9 and V2 were also used. Of the six unique pairings, four were shared among all\nthree mice (V1/J1, V1/J2, V1/J3, and V1/J4). One was shared among two mice (V9/J1), and\none (V2/J4) was found only in ground mouse three\u2019s five most common combinations\n(Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 3A\u2013C, Supplemental Figure 4C). For flight animals, seven\nunique pairings where found in the five most common pairs. V1 was again the\noverwhelmingly most common V family with four of the seven unique pairings including it.\nV3, V2, and V9 were all used by a single animal. Of the seven unique pairs, four were\nshared among all three mice (V1/J1, V1/J2, V1/J3, and V1/J4). These pairings were also\namong the most common in the ground-treatment group. Three (V3/J3, V2/J4, V9/J1) were\nfound in a single mouse\u2019s five most common pairings (Figure 4B, Supplemental Figure 3D\u2013\nF, Supplemental Figure 4D).\nWe undertook similar analysis for Ig\u03ba sequences (Figure 4C\u2013D, Supplemental Figure 3G\u2013L,\nSupplemental Figure 4E\u2013F). The most common V\u03ba-gene family expressed in all mice was\nV5, representing over one-fifth of the repertoire. The second most common V\u03ba-gene family\nin ground animals was V3 while in flight animals it was V6 or V4 (Figure 4C\u2013D,\nSupplemental Figure 3G\u2013L, Supplemental Figure 4E\u2013F). The third most represented V\u03ba-\ngene families was V6 for ground mouse one, and V4 for ground mouse two, and V2 for\nmouse three (Figure 4C, Supplemental Figure 4G\u2013I). In flight animals, the third most\ncommon V\u03ba-gene family was V4 for flight mouse one, and V3 for flight mouse two and\nthree (Figure 4D, Supplemental Figure 4J\u2013L).\nUnlike IgH, Ig\u03ba expressed more variety in V/J pairing variety. In Ig\u03ba there were five\npairings in ground animals (V2/J4, V3/J2, V3/J5, V5/J1, V6/J2) that were not shared with\nthe top five flight-animal pairings (Figure 4C\u2013D, Supplemental Figure 3G\u2013L, Supplemental\nFigure 4E\u2013F). There were also four pairings (V1/J2, V4/J2, V6/J1, V6/J4) found in flight\nanimals not found in the top five ground-animal pairings (Figure 4C\u2013D, Supplemental\nFigure 3G\u2013L, Supplemental Figure 4E\u2013F).\nThe correlation of the average percent of repertoire for V/J combinations between ground\nand flight animals was higher in Ig\u03ba, with a R2 of 0.8795 (p<0.0001), whereas IgH had a R2\nof 0.3296 (p<0.0001) (linear regression). V/J combination usage among animals within each\ntreatment group also showed stronger correlation within Ig\u03ba than IgH in both ground and\nflight treatment groups (Table 4).\nLife Sci Space Res (Amst).

Page 10\n3.4 CDR3\nCDR3 is important for conferring diversity in Ig specificity. Therefore, we assessed whether\nspaceflight had an impact on several properties of CDR3 because changes in CDR3 could\naffect host ability to respond to antigen. We found that CDR3 length in IgH was highly\nvaried. The length ranged from one amino acid to 35 (Figure 5A). The average CDR3\nlengths for all the ground control animals was 12\u00b10. The average CDR3 lengths for flight\nanimals was also 12\u00b11. The CDR3 lengths were not normally distributed in the flight or\nground animals (flight p=<0.0001, ground p=0.0128) with the majority of CDR3 lengths\nfalling between 11 and 14 AAs. We also examined the heavy-chain CDR3 length by isotype\n(Table 5) and by treatment group. We found no significant difference by treatment group or\nby isotype (two-way ANOVA, interaction p=0.8141, isotype p=0.4589, treatment p=0.6225).\nKappa-chain CDR3 length was conserved at nine amino acids with 90.3 to 94.2 percent of\nall light chains having CDR3 rearrangements that were nine amino acids in length (Figure\n5B). Only a small percentage of light chains had eight amino acids (2.8 to 6.9%), or ten\namino acid long (0.9\u20133.9%) CDR3s. Ground mouse one (0.9%), was an exception and was\nenriched for 11 amino acid CDR3s (2.3%) compared to other animals (0.2\u20130.7%). CDR3\nlengths over 18 amino acids were not displayed (20, 25, 27, 29, 32, 35, 36, 37, 39). CDR3\nrearrangements of these lengths were often only detected in one animal and expression of\nthese lengths did not exceed 0.01% of the repertoire. Additionally, these rearrangements\nmay have been identified in error as many of these rearrangements contain intervening\nphenylalanine residues within the There was little overlap among IgH CDR3s regardless of\ntreatment (Figure 6A, C). Of the top five CDR3s found in each animal, we identified 26\nunique CDR3 AA rearrangements. Of those 26 CDR3s, four were found in all six animals.\nTwo additional rearrangements were identified in three animals. One of those\nrearrangements, CASHGSSYLAWFAYW, was found in only flight animals and not found in\nany ground animals. Six CDR3s were found in two animals, and the remainder were found\nin a single animal. The vast majority of CDR3 rearrangements detected were unique to each\nanimal (6,661\u20139,270 rearrangements), though there was a small amount of overlap among\nanimals (103\u2013163 CDR3 rearrangements). For flight animals, 78 CDR3 rearrangements\nwere found in all three animals and 70 were found in all three ground animals. Of the\nrearrangements found in all three animals per treatment group, only 20 rearrangements were\ndetected in all six animals.\nThere was considerable overlap in the top five Ig\u03ba CDR3 rearrangements of each animal\n(Figure 6B, D). Seventeen total top CDR3 rearrangements were identified and all CDR3\nrearrangements were identified in every animal. One CDR3 was the most abundant\nrearrangements in five animals (CQNGHSFPLTF), still ranking third in the remaining\nanimal (F1). Ground control and flight animals shared three rearrangements that ranked\nwithin the top 20 CDR3 in all animals. Overall, between 1,590\u20132,933 unique CDR3 were\ndetected in ground control animals, and between 1,461\u20131,818 unique CDR3 were detected\nin all flight animals (Figure 6). Of the 725 and 579 CDR3 shared in all three ground control\nand flight animals, respectively, 446 were shared between all six ground and flight animals.\nA CDR3 rearrangement nucleotide sequence alignment of one of the top V-D-J-gene\nsegment combinations demonstrates significant variability among mice such that any\nLife Sci Space Res (Amst).

Page 11\nvariability between ground and flight treatment groups cannot be determined with\nconfidence (Figure 7). Additional data sets are needed in order to assess the effect of\nspaceflight on CDR3 formation.\n3.5 Mutations in Complementarity Determining and Framework Regions\nWe also examined mutation frequencies in CDR and framework (FW) regions for each\nanimal because mutations can affect Ig specificity. Mutation frequencies were normalized by\nanimal and Ig region (FW1-3, CDR1-3) by dividing the percent of total substitution\nmutations (total mutations/total productive reads) by respective region length (Figure 8).\nThere were no significant differences between the mutation frequencies of ground control\nand flight animals for any of the Ig regions in both IgH (Student\u2019s t-test, 0.1916<p<0.9978)\nand Igk (Student\u2019s t-test, 0.3175<p<0.9865). When comparing the substitution mutation\nfrequency across Ig regions, more substitution mutations occurred in CDR3 compared to\nother regions in IgH and Ig\u03ba (ANOVA; all p<0.05).\n4 Discussion\nSpaceflight and ground-based analog models induce phenotypic and functional changes in\nT- and B- lymphocyte populations. Spaceflight also affects bone marrow, the site of B-cell\ndifferentiation and development. Therefore, we wanted to know whether the stress and\nphysiological changes associated with spaceflight would affect the normal development of\nthe highly-diversified and highly-specific antigen receptors on B-lymphocytes. If so, the\nability to respond to pathogens might be affected. We characterized the antibody repertoire\nof C57BL/6Tac mice flown aboard the ISS and ground control animals using HTS and\nRNA-Seq.\nHTS studies of antibody repertoires typically employ polymerase chain reaction\namplification of Ig specific sequences from sorted B-cell populations. We assessed the B cell\nrepertoire in whole spleen tissue because of the limitations of the primary science, a\nverification flight of mouse housing hardware. This precluded the sorting of cell\npopulations. We previously showed that similar data could be generated using whole spleen\ntissue compared to whole spleen cell suspensions (Rettig et al., 2017). Although we do not\naccount for B-cell subpopulations (Yang et al., 2015, Kaplinsky et al., 2014), we do measure\nthe total splenic Ig repertoire. Additionally, since we did not use specific amplification of Ig\nsequences the depth of sequencing was not as high as some have accomplished looking at Ig\ngene usage (Yang et al., 2015, Kaplinsky et al., 2014, Menzel et al., 2014). We have\ncompared of amplified and unamplified data sets by our lab show reasonable correlations of\nthe data, with more V-gene segments being detected in the unamplified data sets (Rettig\n2017, In Revision). Amplification with multiplex Ig specific primers may introduce\namplification bias as primers may bind with varying efficiency to V-gene segments, although\nthere have been recent advances in experimental approach to address amplification bias\n(Wardemann, 2017). We also found that the type of RNA-Seq analysis we are using in the\nassessment of younger C57Bl/6J mouse Ig gene usage, correlated well with that of studies\nusing amplification (Rettig et al., 2017). Therefore, we feel we have a reasonable snapshot\nLife Sci Space Res (Amst).

In addition, the\nsample preparation allows additional data mining of valuable mouse samples.\nIn both humans and mice, early B-cell development occurs in the fetal liver prior to postnatal\ndevelopment in the bone marrow. We attempted to determine the Ig repertoire within the\nadult liver of the ground and flight animals in comparison to the splenic Ig repertoire.\nUnfortunately, few Ig sequences were recovered in liver samples suggesting few B cells are\nactually resident or circulating in the liver under normal, steady-state conditions. The liver\nkappa chain V-gene repertoire did correlate some with the usage in the spleen and probably\nreflects circulating B-cell Ig expression, but we did not confirm that. We focused our efforts\non the spleen data.\nWhile previous analyses by our lab used splenic mRNA pooled from four animals (Rettig et\nal., Submitted for Publication in PLOS ONE, (Rettig et al., 2017)), the current study\nassessed individual mice and exhibited significantly more mouse-to-mouse variation than\none might expect in inbred mice; even within treatment groups and compared to pooled\nmouse samples. Overall, V-gene segment usage correlated when analyzed using pairwise\nlinear regression of animals within ground and flight treatment groups and there did not\nappear to be an impact of spaceflight on B-gene segment use. It is possible that differences\nin gene segment usage in ground and flight animals would be observed upon immunization.\nStudies on the effects of spaceflight in an immunized amphibian model showed altered VH-\ngene family and Ig class usage (Boxio et al., 2005, Bascove et al., 2009).\nWe performed a number of analyses to determine if the Ig gene rearrangement process was\naffected by spaceflight. Averaged V-gene segment usage between the ground control and\nflight animals was moderately to highly correlated (VH: R2=0.5922, p <0.0001; V\u03ba:\nR2=0.831, p <0.0001). Many of the most abundant V-gene sequences were shared in flight\nand ground animals and there was no statistically significant difference in usage of\nindividual top V-gene segments between ground control and flight animals (Student\u2019s t-test,\np=0.06478\u20130.9609). Similarly, no differences in D-, JH- or J\u03ba-gene segment usage and IgH\nconstant region usage was seen between ground and flight animals.\nWe also examined whether spaceflight would affect the V/J-gene segment combinations that\nnormally occur in specific pathogen-free mice. These too, were not different between ground\ncontrol and flight animals for IgH and Ig\u03ba. V/J-gene segment combinations were moderately\nto highly correlated (IgH: R2=0.3296, Ig\u03ba: R2=0.8795, both p<0.0001). An assessment of\nthe impact of hypergravity on the similarly assembled T cell receptor repertoire of neonatal\nmice showed low correlation of individual Beta chain V- and J-gene segment recombination\nfrequencies between control animals and animals subjected to centrifugation. 85% of gene\nV/J-gene segment combinations were not shared among the two treatment groups (Ghislin et\nal., 2015) and the differences could be attributed to changes in somatic recombination\nmachinery under altered gravity conditions (Schenten et al., 2013, Ghislin et al., 2015).\nThe combinatorial diversity of Ig was shown through the assessment of overall CDR3\nsequence overlap among animals, as a large number of sequences were unique to only one\nanimal. Little overlap was observed in the top 5 H-CDR3 rearrangements within all six\nLife Sci Space Res (Amst).

Page 13\nground and flight animals which totaled to 26 CDR3 rearrangements. Thirteen of these\nCDR3 rearrangements were only identified in one animal. More overlap was observed in the\ntop 5 \u03ba-CDR3 rearrangements within all six ground and flight animals which totaled 17\nCDR3 rearrangements, which were identified in all animals.\nThe mice studied in this investigation were not challenged and were housed under specific-\npathogen free conditions. Mutational frequency in Ig is normally associated with antigen\nstimulation (Garcia et al., 1996). Therefore, we did not expect that these mice were\nundergoing high amounts of somatic mutations. The majority of the mutations detected\noccurred in CDR3 in both ground and flight mice. It is possible that we will see differences\nin mutation frequency between ground control and flight animals after experimental immune\nchallenge. The frequency of somatic hypermutations in P. waltl immunized in space was\nslightly lower than animals immunized on earth (Bascove et al., 2011). An experiment with\nantigen challenge of the Ig repertoire will be necessary to test this hypothesis.\nThe animals used in this experiment were older (35 weeks). The expression of genes\nnecessary for Ig recombination do go down as mice age (Cancro, 2009). Therefore, it may\nbe possible that we do not see differences between the treatment groups because the\nperturbations of spaceflight are not enough to disrupt the reduced B cell differentiations\noccurring in 35-week-old mice under normal steady-state conditions. Additionally, the half-\nlife of B cells in secondary lymphoid organs is between four and seven weeks (Fulcher and\nBasten, 1997). Given the brief time that the mice were subjected to space flight (three\nweeks) it is likely that the exposure was not long enough to affect V/D/J recombination in\nthe repertoire. Additional experiments, especially with young mice, will be needed to test\nthis hypothesis.\nAnimals in this experiment were older and supplied from a different vendor (Taconic) than\nthe 9\u201311-week-old C57BL/6J mice from Jackson Laboratories used in our previous\nexperiments ((Rettig et al., 2017), (Rettig et al., In Revision). To assess whether differences\nexisted in the Ig repertoire, between the older C57BL/6Tac mice and the younger C57BL/6J\nmice, we compared gene segment usage between the two mouse cohorts. Because no\ndifferences in top V-gene segments, (D)J-gene segments, and constant region usage were\ndetected between RR1 ground control and flight animals, all six animals were pooled and\ncompared to the C57BL/6J cohort. We selected the 25 most abundant V-gene segments from\nboth RR1 and C57BL/6J cohorts, resulting in 33 top IgHV and 34 top Ig\u03baV. We found that\nseven of 35 IgHV and eight of 32 IG\u03baV were expressed at significantly different levels\nwithin the repertoire between the two cohorts (Student\u2019s t-test). These differences are largely\ndriven by gene segments that are highly expressed in the RR1 cohort such as IGHV1-80,\nwhich represented 2.04 \u00b1 0.26% of the repertoire in RR1 animals and 6.6 \u00b1 2.40% of the\nrepertoire in the C57BL/6J cohort (Student\u2019s t-test, p=0.0032). This is even more\npronounced in IG\u03baV5\u201339, which represented 21.41 \u00b1 7.50% of the repertoire in RR1\nanimals and only 4.73 \u00b1 4.93% of the repertoire in the C57BL/6J cohort (Student\u2019s t-test,\np=0.0109).\nWe also performed a linear regression of top V-gene segment usage, which showed poor\ncorrelation between cohorts in both IgH (R2 = 0.1568, p=0.0226) and Ig\u03ba (R2 = 0.1681,\nLife Sci Space Res (Amst). Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 February 01.\nAuthor\nManuscript\nAuthor\nManuscript\nAuthor\nManuscript\nAuthor\nManuscript\nWard et al. Page 14\np=0.0160). D-gene segment usage was only significantly different IGHD1-1, which\nrepresented 39.7 \u00b1 5.23% of the repertoire in RR1 animals and 26.49 \u00b1 0.94% of the\nrepertoire in the C57BL/6J cohort (Student\u2019s t-test, p=0.0040). We found that J-gene\nsegment usage varied between the two cohorts in three out of five IG\u03baJ and no differences in\nIGHV were detected (student\u2019s t-test). IgH constant region usage was significantly different\nfor IgD (RR1: 0.63 \u00b1 0.22%, C57BL6/J: 4.60 \u00b1 0.69%; Student\u2019s t-test, p=0.0074) and IgG\n(RR1: 23.83 \u00b1 6.19%, C57BL6/J: 9.65 \u00b1 6.19%; Student\u2019s t-test, p=0.0074).\nAlthough we cannot determine whether these differences are attributed to differences in\nvendor or differences in age, it is likely that repertoire differences are driven by a more\nmature Ig repertoire within the RR1 animals, as a higher percentage of IgH sequences\ndemonstrate class switching. Both cohorts were unimmunized and maintained under specific\npathogen-free conditions.\nIn conclusion, we have been able to successfully characterize immunoglobulin gene segment\nusage and junctional diversity within the antibody repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6Tac\nmice flown aboard the ISS. Individual gene segment usage remained similar among animals\nwithin and among treatment groups, with the most abundant gene segments being conserved\nacross all animals. Gene segment combinations and CDR3 sequences were highly varied,\ndemonstrating the combinatorial diversity of the antibody repertoire, but that variation\nreflects the dynamics of individualized selection of Ig molecules and not any impact of\nspaceflight. A larger sample size would help solidify this conclusion, but these data provide\npreliminary suggestions that the recombinatorial processes that lead to the diverse Ig\nrepertoires in mice are not affected by a short trip to and stay on the ISS. These data do not\npreclude that differences in the Ig repertoires of ground and flight animals will not be seen\nduring active immunization or in younger, possibly more recombinatorily active mice.\nCurrent studies in our lab aim to characterize antibody repertoire dynamics upon antigen\nchallenge using a murine anti-orthostatic suspension model and during a future space flight.\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\nReferences\nAdemokun A, Wu YC, Martin V, Mitra R, Sack U, Baxendale H, Kipling D, Dunn-Walters DK.\nVaccination-Induced Changes In Human B-Cell Repertoire And Pneumococcal Igm And Iga\nAntibody At Different Ages.
