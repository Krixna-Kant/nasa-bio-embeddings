TNO1, a TGN-localized SNARE-interacting
protein, modulates root skewing in
Arabidopsis thaliana
Rahul Roy1,2,4 and Diane C. Bassham1,2,3*
Abstract
Background: The movement of plant roots within the soilis key to their ability to interactwith theenvironment
and maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition.Directional growth ofroots occurs by a combinationof sensing
external cues, hormonalsignaling and cytoskeletal changes in theroot cells. Roots growingon slanted,
impenetrable growthmediumdisplay a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants withdeviationsin these
phenotypes assist inidentifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a rolefor a trans-Golgi
network-localizedprotein in root skewing.
Results: We found that ArabidopsisthalianaTNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering
factor localized atthe trans-Golginetwork, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root
skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1roots increases upon microtubulestabilization, but is
insensitive to microtubuledestabilization.Microtubule destabilization leads to severedefects incell morphology in
tno1seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected inthe mutant roots, suggesting that theincrease incell
file rotation is independentof the orientation of microtubule arrays.
Conclusions: We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing ina mechanism that is dependent onmicrotubules
butis notlinked to disruption of theorientation of microtubule arrays. Inaddition, TNO1 is required for
maintenance of cell morphologyin mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls. The TGN-localized SNARE
machinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root
growth.
